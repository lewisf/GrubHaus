          <h3>What is GrubHaus</h3>

<p>Grub Haus is an attempt at creating a new digital recipe publishing and viewing experience. It is meant to be responsive and give users a more pleasurable experience when reading recipes, given that we have new media formats like tablets and ultrabooks.</p>

<h3>Motivations behind GrubHaus</h3>

<p>We're all foodies, and every now and then we want to look for food to make online. However, we find that websites like Epicurious and Allrecipes aren't up to snuff with what can be done with online media, especially on the beauty standpoint. We want to make the publishing experience simple and the viewing experience beautiful.</p>

<h3>What GrubHaus brings to the table:</h3>

<p>When reading traditional recipe layouts, it's often hard to keep track of the time for each step ... and sometimes digging through the instruction text just to find how long I have before I have to do the next step is painful and frustrating, especially when there isn't a lot of time between steps. Here's an example of a GrubHaus recipe page (recipe instructions and ingredients text sourced from Allrecipes)</p>

<p>In addition to that, we wanted to make sure that recipe editing/creating is easy. Thanks to BackboneJS, we were able to create a fluid user experience that just involves double clicking on whatever you want to edit/add to bring up corresponding edit form. Editable areas are highlighted yellow on hover.</p>

<p>We also have pretty profile pages, so in the future, you can just send someone a link to your profile and they'll be able to see all your publications!</p>

<h3>Features</h3>

<p>GrubHaus includes a lot of features you'd expect that help you get your recipes published and make it accessible to other people.</p>

<ol>
<li>Creating/Publishing recipes</li>
<li>Searching through recipes or just browsing all recipes.</li>
<li>Comma separated tagging of recipes so that you can attach searchable terms to a recipe, eg. "Chinese"</li>
<li>If you have an account

<ul>
<li>Favoriting recipes</li>
<li>Forking recipes (cloning them and modifying them for yourself)</li>
<li>Adding your say on a instruction step by step basis, so you can say you did something different and it worked out.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Facebook Integration (Login, Sharing)</li>
<li>Viewing another user's profile/following the user.</li>
</ol><p>We also included an admin flag on each user that can be toggled on or off by the application owner. When in admin mode, the header turns black, and the admin gets access to publish/unpublish/delete/edit any recipe.</p>

<h3>Future enhancements</h3>

<p>So far GrubHaus is in beta. Even though it is potentially launchable at this state, we have a lot of features that we want to build for the future. These features include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Finding ingredient substitutions</li>
<li>Being able to view the tree diagram of all the forks of a recipe</li>
<li>Making the profile info page more of a "resume for cooks" page.</li>
<li>Printing and framing recipes</li>
</ul><h3>Documentation</h3>

<p>Docs can be found in the <code>docs/</code> folder of the project root.</p>

<h3>Deployed</h3>

<p>The current beta version is deployed at: <a href="grubhaus.herokuapp.com">Grubhaus on Heroku</a>. Feel free to sign up via Facebook or just with an <a href="mailto:lewis.f.chung+grubhaus@gmail.com">email</a> and give us feedback. We'd love to tackle bugs as they're coming in.</p>
